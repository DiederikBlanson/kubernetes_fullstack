# Adding Multiple Nodes to a Kubernetes Cluster
Source: 
- https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-kubernetes-ha#4-create-a-microk8s-multinode-cluster

### Prerequisites
- The new node should have `microk8s` installed.

<br/>

### Step 1: Generate a Token for the New Node
In order to connect the new node to the control plane (master), a token must be generated by the control plane. Run the following command on the control plane:

```bash
microk8s add-node
```

Note: this token is valid for a short amount of time.

<br/>

### Step 2: Choose the Type of Node
On the new node, run the command provided in the output of the previous step to join the cluster as a worker or master node.

<br/>

### Step 3: Add New Node to /etc/hosts
Finally, you must add the new node's IP address and hostname to the /etc/hosts file on all nodes in the cluster. To do this, run the following command on each node, replacing node-ip and node-name with the appropriate values:
```bash
sudo echo "[node-ip] [node-name"] << /etc/hosts
```

<br/>

## Other Commands
- To view the pods on a specific node, run the following command, replacing <node> with the node's hostname: 
```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide --field-selector spec.nodeName=<node>
```
